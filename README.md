#### Find Mode
- Type to fuzzy search by **filename**
- Press `Enter` to navigate to the selected file's directory
- Press `Ctrl-O` to open the file in your editor

#### Grep Mode
- Type to search by **file content**
- See matching files with line numbers and context
- Press `Enter` to navigate to the file's directory
- Press `Ctrl-O` to open the file at the matched line

## 🎨 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Quick File Search
```bash
$ ff
# Type "config" to fuzzy find files matching "config"
# Use arrow keys to select
# Press Enter to cd to the file's directory
# Or press Ctrl-O to open the file
```

### Example 2: Search Code Content
```bash
$ ff grep
# Type "function handleClick"
# See all files containing this text
# Files show with line numbers highlighted
# Press Ctrl-O to open in editor at that exact line
```

### Example 3: Dynamic Mode Switching
```bash
$ ff
# Start browsing files in Find mode
# Type "README" to find README files
# Press TAB to switch to Grep mode
# Type "installation" to search content
# Press TAB again to return to Find mode
```

### Example 4: Navigation Workflow
```bash
$ ff find
# Search for "utils.js"
# Press Enter to cd to the directory
$ pwd  # You're now in the file's directory
```

## ⚙️ Customization

### Change Default Editor

By default, `ff` uses VSCode (`code`) if available, otherwise falls back to `$EDITOR`. To customize:

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
export EDITOR=nvim     # Neovim
# or
export EDITOR=vim      # Vim
# or
export EDITOR=nano     # Nano
```

### Modify Search Behavior

Edit the `ff.sh` file to customize:
- FZF options (layout, theme, colors)
- Preview window size and position
- Key bindings
- Search commands

## 🎯 How It Works

### Find Mode
1. Uses `fd` (or `find`) to list all files and directories
2. Pipes results to `fzf` for interactive filtering
3. Shows file previews using `bat` (with syntax highlighting)
4. Shows directory trees using `eza` or `tree`

### Grep Mode
1. Uses `ripgrep` (or `grep`) to search file contents as you type
2. Results show filename, line number, and matched content
3. Preview highlights the matched line in context
4. Opening with `Ctrl-O` jumps directly to the matched line

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "fzf not found" error
```bash
# Check if fzf is installed
which fzf

# If not installed, install it:
# macOS
brew install fzf

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install fzf
```

### Preview not displaying properly
Install the optional tools for better previews:
```bash
# macOS
brew install bat eza tree

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install bat eza tree
```

### Editor not opening files
Check your `EDITOR` environment variable:
```bash
echo $EDITOR

# If empty or not your preferred editor, set it:
export EDITOR=vim  # or your preferred editor
```

### VSCode not opening at the correct line
Ensure VSCode command-line tools are installed:
1. Open VSCode
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Linux/Windows)
3. Type "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"
4. Select it and restart your terminal

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: Quick Project Navigation
```bash
# From anywhere in your project
ff
# Type the filename you want to work on
# Press Enter to navigate there
# Your shell is now in that directory!
```

### Tip 2: Finding TODO Comments
```bash
ff grep
# Type "TODO"
# See all TODO comments across your codebase
# Press Ctrl-O to open and fix them
```

### Tip 3: Configuration File Hunting
```bash
ff
# Type "config"
# Quickly find all configuration files
```

### Tip 4: Searching for Functions
```bash
ff grep
# Type "function myFunction"
# Find where functions are defined
# Jump directly to the definition
```

## 📊 Performance

`ff` is designed to be fast even in large codebases:
- With `fd` and `ripgrep`: Handles repositories with 100,000+ files efficiently
- Real-time search results as you type
- Minimal memory footprint
- Works great on both small and large projects
